# Neural Networks for MNIST

MNIST is the simplest data set and the very first data set to learn neural networks. Here two classical models implemented in Pytorch and their corresponding trained weights are uploaded. 

- Multi-perceptron neural networks

  It is a three fully connected layers neural network with one hidden layer. It is trained on MNIST from scratch and has the training accuracy of 100%, testing accuracy of 97.80%.

  The trained weights can be found in `multi_perceptron_MNIST_params.pkl`.

- LeNet

  LeNet is the very first effective convolutional neural network. It has two convolution layers followed by two fully connected layers. It was trained on MNIST from scratch and achieved the testing accuracy of 99.03%.

  The trained weights can be found in `LeNet_MNIST_params.pkl`.
